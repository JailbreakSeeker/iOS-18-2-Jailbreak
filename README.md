## Palera1n Online Jailbreak
<br>
The next highest-ranking iOS 18.2 jailbreak page is Xookz, which recommends Palera1n Online as the preferred jailbreak tool.
<br><br>
Palera1n jailbreak is compatible with iOS 18.1 and is expected to support iOS 18.2 as well. However, it doesn’t work on all device models and isn’t available as an online method. For greater compatibility and convenience, Palera1n Online is recommended, as it supports all device models and provides an easy online jailbreak option.
